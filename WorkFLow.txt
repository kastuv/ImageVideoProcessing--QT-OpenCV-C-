//Check out this Class for QT before going the codebase;
(QtQuickPaintedItem)
https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qquickpainteditem.html
- In General: We use this to paint Images on QML


//Image is stored in a MAT
# Mat is where image pixels are stored in a MATRIX form as a data.


How the process is working;
- Loading the image into MAT
- The data placed as a MATRIX, we load every position of matrix data into QImage
- We redraw the Image from data, by using QquickPaintedItem in QML
